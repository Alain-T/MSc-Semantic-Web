# MSc-Semantic-Web

This repository contains my assignement for my semantic web course (based on W3C standard). Semantic web allows to :

- Represent and publish sematic-rich data on the web (RDF)
- Select and query these data very precisely on the web (SPARQL)
- Present the notions of vocabularies in order to reason and deduce new data to enrich semantic descriptions (RDFS, OWL, SKOS)
- Trace and follow data history (VOiD, DCAT, PROV-O, etc.).

In the case of data science, semantic web is a valuable source of open data that can help to enrich a model.
